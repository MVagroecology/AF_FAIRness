	"description": "The potential erosion risk of Finnish agricultural lands data describes the average erosion risk of surface soil to water erosion (kg/ha/y) in the case of bare fallow conditions. The data is based on RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) and it covers almost all agricultural lands in Finland in 10×10 m resolution. The calculations include the effects of rainfall (R), soil type (K), slope length (L), slope steepness (S), and bare fallow (C=0.5) on erosion, but exclude the effects of other human activities (P). The effect of rainfall is based on measured precipitation data from 2007-2013. The total size of the data is approx. 1 GB and it includes one file.\nThe data is derived from erosion susceptibility of land areas (2×2 m)",
