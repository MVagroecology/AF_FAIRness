	"description": "The erosion susceptibility of Finnish agricultural lands’ data describes the average susceptibility of surface soil to water erosion (kg/ha/y). The data is based on RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) and it covers almost all agricultural lands in Finland in 2×2 m resolution. The calculations include the effects of rainfall (R), soil type (K), slope length (L), and slope steepness (S) on erosion, but exclude the effects of vegetation cover and human activities (C=1, P=1). The effect of rainfall is based on measured precipitation data from 2007-2013. The data is spatially consistent, and it allows comparison of erosion susceptibility between different areas and locations, but for actual erosion rates it needs to be scaled down with appropriate C and P factor values.",
