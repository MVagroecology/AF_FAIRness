Members record observations for numerous reasons, including participation in citizen science projects, school projects, and personal fulfillment. Observations made by the members are verified by the community.  Observations become candidates for Research Grade when they have a photo, date, and coordinates. They become \"Research Grade\" when the community agrees on an identification.",
