	"description": "This database summarises evidence from the scientific literature (studies) about the effects of conservation actions such as methods of habitat or species management. The dataset contains synopses of evidence that review the effectiveness of all actions which could be implemented to conserve a given species group or habitat or to tackle a particular conservation issue. Expert panels are then asked to assess the effectiveness (or not) of actions, based on the summarized evidence. The database also contains summaries of actions proposed in farmland conservation.",
