	"description": "Trees perform many essential functions. They sequester carbon, reduce soil erosion, and provide habitats for a diversity of unique species. Of course, humans have also relied on trees for our entire history—from building materials, to energy, to food. The European relationship with trees, especially in recent centuries, has largely been one of aggressive exploitation, with little attention paid to preservation. For now, trees are still an essential resource for our civilization, but we are also coming to terms with the fact that protecting and restoring them is an essential aspect of building a sustainable Europe. The High Resolution Layer Tree Cover Density product offers information on the percentage of tree cover in a given area. With its three-year update cycle and high-resolution data, this product is one of best publicly available European tree cover maps. The application areas for this product are manifold, from assisting in continental land cover/land use monitoring initiatives to supporting regional forest management projects. Additionally, the High Resolution Layer Dominant Leaf Type and the High Resolution Layer Forest Type product are derived from Tree Cover Density datasets. The product also serves as a key monitoring tool for Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) reporting and the European Environmental Agency’s State of the Environment reports, but it was designed with a broad user community mind, so its applications are as diverse as Europe's forests themselves. There is a Tree Cover Density product at 10m and 100m resolution.",
