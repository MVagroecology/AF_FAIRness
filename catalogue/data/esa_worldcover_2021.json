	"description": "This dataset contains spatial data about groundcover classes, based on a last update in 2021. The product map is viewable and downloadable on a 10m resolution. It is a fast generation and validation of a world land cover based on Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 constellations, contains 10 land cover classes and additionally mangroves, with 77% overall accuracy, independently validated.\nThe WorldCover products are delivered in a regular latitude/longitude grid (EPSG:4326) with the ellipsoid WGS 1984 (Terrestrial radius=6378 km). The legend includes 11 generic classes that appropriately describe the land surface at 10m: \"Tree cover\", \"Shrubland\", \"Grassland\", \"Cropland\", \"Built-up\", \"Bare / sparse vegetation\u201d, \u201cSnow and Ice\u201d, \u201cPermanent water bodies\u201d, \u201cHerbaceous Wetland\u201d, \u201cMangrove\u201d and \u201cMoss and lichen\".",
